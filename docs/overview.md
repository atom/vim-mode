## Overview

* There are only currently two modes, command mode and insert mode.
* Motions have repeat support, `d3w` will delete three words.
* Registers exist but are limited to just named registers (a-h) and the
  default buffer doesn't yet save on delete operations.
* Insert mode can be entered using 'i' or 'O'.
