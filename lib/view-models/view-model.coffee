# Public: Base class for all view models; a view model
#         is the model attached to a VimCommandModeInputView
#         which is used when a given operator, motion
#         needs extra keystroke.
#
# Ivars:
#
#   @completionCommand - if set will automatically be triggered on the editorView
#                        when the `confirm` method is called on the view model
#
#   @value - automatically set to the value of typed into the `VimCommandModeInputView`
#            when the `confirm` method is called
#
class ViewModel
  # Public: Override this in subclasses for custom initialization
  #
  # operator - An operator, motion, prefix, etc with `@editorView` and `@state` set
  #
  # opts - the options to be passed to `VimCommandModeInputView`. Possible options are:
  #
  #            - class {String} - the class of the view to be added to the bottom of the screen
  #
  #            - hidden {Boolean} - tells the view whether or not it should be hidden
  #
  #            - singleChar {Boolean} - tells the view whether it should only listen for a single
  #                                      character or an entire string
